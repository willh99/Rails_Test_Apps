Rails Test Apps
===============

This is a collection of simple test applications for the purpose of mastering
the Ruby on Rails framework.

The version of Ruby instlled for this project was version 5.1.6  as
recommended by [railstutorial.org](http://version.railstutorial.org/) using
the gem installer as follows:

`gem install rails -v 5.1.6`

The initial app, "hello_app," was then created with the command:
`rails _5.1.6_ new hello_app -d postgresql`

Gemfiles within the applcation can then install dependencies using:
`bundle install --without production`
Although the exclution of production may not be needed by those able to run
natively.

To run the application, run `rails server` or `rails s`.  If running within
an online IDE, you will likely have to set your binding address and
port number like so:
`rails server -b $IP -p $PORT`

These apps were initially developed in *c9.io* and deployed to Heroku.
Apps can be deployed to Heroku using the following commands (assuming
you have an account with Heroku and have initailized and commited to a
git repository):

```
$ heroku login
Enter you Heroku credentials.
Email: youremail@here.com
Password (typing will be hidden):
Authentication successful

$ heroku keys:add
Found existing public key: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Uploading SSH public key /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub... done

$ heroku create
Creating app... done, â¬¢ mighty-hamlet-84912
https://mighty-hamlet-84912.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/mighty-hamlet-84912.git

$ git push heroku master
```
*Note that heroku does not support sqlite which is the default db for some*
*rails applcations. Instead it is recommended to use postgreSQL.  More*
*information on the proper configuration can be found* 
[here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sqlite3)

In some simple learning applications, it may be desirable to use scaffolds to
generate templates for structures within the database. This can be done as such:
`rails generate scaffold mytablename field1:integer field2:text`

This will then gernate both the database configuration and a simple interface
where data can be imput from the browser. Remeber to migrate the database
when adding scaffolds (and in general).  `bundle exec rake db:migrate`

Remember that your database will need to be migrated within production as well.
In Heroku, this can be done as follows:
`heroku run rake db:migrate`
